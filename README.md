# 🧩 Bash Automation Scripts

Welcome to my **Bash playground**! 🐚  
This repo is a hands-on DevOps learning journey where I experiment, practice, and master Bash scripting — from basics to system administration, networking, and fun terminal tricks.

## Folder Overview
- basics/: Fundamentals (variables, conditions, loops)
- file-ops/: File and directory automation
- system-admin/: System monitoring & administration
- network-tools/: Networking & connectivity helpers
- fun-experiments/: Terminal tricks & playful experiments

## How to Run Scripts
```bash
chmod +x script_name.sh
./script_name.sh
```
or
```bash
bash script_name.sh
```

## Learning Goals
- Master Bash syntax & operators
- Automate Linux tasks
- Practice Git workflow (branch → commit → PR → merge)
- Experiment with terminal features (colors, animations, fun outputs)
- Build a professional DevOps portfolio

## Git Tips
- Feature branch per script, e.g., feature/disk-alert
- Commit messages:
```
feat: add spinner animation script
fix: correct file path in backup script
docs: update README with new exercise
```
